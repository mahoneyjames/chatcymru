    h1 About
    p This site is step 1 in an attempt to provide an up to date listing of Welsh meetup groups.
    p Site developed by 
      a(href="http://www.jamesmahoney.co.uk") James Mahoney
      | , Welsh software developer that needs to speak more Welsh.
    p Data comes from this Google spreadsheet 
      a(href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zzhf4SebQ5IIU1PfrrAzh1d0Q2ZLDaesN-cQ2Ux0bwA/edit#gid=2043427168") here
      | .
    p All this information is maintained by hand based on groups known about in real life, or referenced on various Welsh learner’s forums or Welsh for adults websites.
    p As the site becomes a little more mature the plan is to find some volunteers to curate the list of meetups, and open it up to cover a wider area.
